All the scripts are written in Python. 
There is one Bash script that can be used to run a designated day's python script, part 1 or 2 of the puzzle, and the test or full input.
flags for runDay.sh:
  -d [number] designates the day you wan to run for the script. default is 1
  -t if this flag is set, the test input is used otherwise, the full puzzle input is used.
  -f if this flag is set, the Python script for the second part of the puzzle is used, otherwise the script for the first part is used.
